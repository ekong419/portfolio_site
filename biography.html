          <h2 class="About">Allow me to introduce myself...</h2>
          <p class="About">My earliest memory of expressing my artistic side was during my kindergarten ceramics class. I enjoyed taking something in its raw form and creating it into an art piece (by my 5 year-old standards and of course, my mom). I continued to mold and paint pottery until my mom claimed there was no more space at home to display my art work, even though I tried to make useful pieces, such as vases, bowls, etc. Although she didn't explicitly crush my dream to become a ceramist, I was always taught that art was just a hobby.</p>
          <h5 class="About">So I convinced myself I wasn't really a creative person anyways and focused my attention on different subjects.</h5>

      <section class="About_page">
        <div class="wrapper_about">
          <p class="About">Fast forward 20 years and I'm knee deep in Excel sheets filled with numbers and graphs. Life had guided me to the hospitality industry as a revenue analyst for hotels. Day in and day out, I would analyze the current market conditions and historical data to price hotels competitively.</p>
          <h5 class="About">I like the analysis part of the job, however, I was yearning for some type of creativity.</h5>
          <p class="About">When creating excelt reports, I found enjoyment in figuring out the best way to present data and the easiest way for users to find the data, whether it was adding a search tool or adding color to make something stand out. I contemplated a career change and a few friends who were doing UX design described to me their field and thought it would be suitable for me as I wanted to use both my right and left-brain. From what I heard about UX design, I'm able to analyze people and solve problems through design.</p>
          <h5 class="About">I felt I wanted to have a career that did more to help people and decided revenue management was not the way to fulfill that.</h5>
          <p class="About">After a few years doing revenue management, I found the courage to do a career change towards UX design.</p>

      <div class="wrapper_about">
        <section class="about_intro">
          <p class="About">To start my career change process, I enrolled into the Thinkful design program. Through the program, I have discovered my passion that highlights my strengths. I always thought of myself as an empathetic person, trying to related to people and seeing something from a different point of view. I found that this characteristic is quite important for designing for a good user experience as well as branding. Although design is a big part of UX, solving problems and observing how people react to design decisions is the catalyst for the aesthetic portion.</p>
          <h5 class="About">I find that UX design is the perfect combination of tapping into my analytical side while expressing it through design.</h5>
          <p class="About">When I'm not immersing myself in user personas and prototyping, I enjoy spending time in the kitchen, cooking and baking new recipes. I also like fitness, ranging from downward dog to burpees. Occasstionally, the outdoor calls where I go hike the Dolomites or surf in Bali.<br><br>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
