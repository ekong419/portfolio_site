                <p class="Busybus_page">Due to an expansion by the local city transit system, numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes service the same bus stop. Riders would like to know which is the next arriving bus and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.</p>

                  <li>- Refresh arrows were changed to <span class="important">Share Location function</span>: It was redundant since the frame can be refreshed by swiping down</li>
                  <li>- Bookmark icon was replaced with a <span class="important">Star Icon</span> to represent the user's <span class="important">favorites</span></li>
                  <li>- <span class="important">Extended the top navigation bar</span> to include the back button and the other icons to give a sense of <span class="important">separation</span> from the key content on the screen</li>
                  <li>- <span class="important">Added space</span> between the icons as they were too close together</li>
                  <li>- <span class="important">Increased the font size</span> of the bus stop name, allowing more <span class="important">distinct hierarchy</span> for the frame</li>
                  <li>- <span class="important">Removed the gray background</span> of the bus lines and used lines instead to <span class="important">visually open up the design</span> as well as making it easier to read</li>
                  <li>- The call to actions in the footer navigation bar were <span class="important">moved up</span> since they were bleeding into the safe zone of the device</li>

                <p class="Busybus_page">There were major changes from the second high fidelity iteration to the coded version because the client provided the asset containing the routes and arrival frequency of each bus that services the Washington and State bus stop at this stage.</p>

                <p class="Busybus_page">Changes for the final iteration were:</p>
                  <ul class="final_iteration">
                    <li>- <span class="important">Removed "inbound/outbound" segmented control</span> due to the multiple categories provided in the asset</li>
                    <li>- By <span class="important">listing</span> all the bus lines and <span class="important">separating</span> them by the categories, it is easier for the user to see all the transit options by just scrolling</li>
                    <li>- The <span class="important">icons in the header navigation bar</span> in the paper and visual design prototype have been replaced with a <span class="important">menu icon</span>. Since there could be additional calls to action that are important to users, such as accessing other favorites, checking on general alerts, or overal setting preferences. With multiple options, I compiled them into a menu, rather than have 4 or 5 icons in the frame.</li>

              <p class="Busybus_page">The final product solves the problem riders were having with the bus stop at Washington and State. BusyBus informs users the arrival times of buses servicing Washington and State. The product also provides users with a visual aid, mapping out the user's current location as well as the location of the desired bus stop.</p>
              <p class="Busybus_page">A few takeaways from this project:</p>
              <p class="Busybus_page"><span class="important">Expect the unexpected:</span> The client's requirements can change at any point in time. I started off designing the app going in one direction, however when the client provided the content of the app, the design drastically changed to accomodate the information. The project taught me to be flexible and quick to adapt.</p>
              <p class="Busybus_page"><span class="important">Lost in translation:</span> BusyBus taught me to design realistically. Even if a designer creates the most aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly design, it may not translate well when coded. I learned to create designs that are not only user-friendly, but that also work well within the digital world.</p>
