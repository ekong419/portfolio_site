                <p class="Busybus_page">Due to an expansion by the local city transit system, numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes service the same bus stop. Riders would like to know which is the next arriving bus and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.</p>

                  <p class="Busybus_page">50% found transit apps to be reliable</p>

These themes are important for a transit app since for some users, public transit is a key factor in their daily lives and they depend on its efficiency.<br> For the content in the frame, I decided to include the time of arrival for the next three buses because not all users will be at the bus stop, which I learned from the responses of my user survey. Therefore, with future bus arrival times, users are able to plan ahead if they wish.</p>

                  <li>- <span class="important">Removed the gray background</span> of the bus lines and used lines instead to <span class="important">visually open up the design</span> as well as making it easier to read</li>
                  <li>- The call to actions in the footer navigation bar were <span class="important">moved up</span> since they were bleeding into the safe zone of the device</li>

                    <li>- By <span class="important">listing</span> all the bus lines and <span class="important">separating</span> them by the categories, it is easier for the user to see all the transit options by just scrolling</li>
                    <li>- The <span class="important">icons in the header navigation bar</span> in the paper and visual design prototype have been replaced with a <span class="important">menu icon</span>. Since there could be additional calls to action that are important to users, such as accessing other favorites, checking on general alerts, or overal setting preferences. With multiple options, I compiled them into a menu, rather than have 4 or 5 icons in the frame.</li>

              <p class="Busybus_page">The final product solves the problem riders were having with the bus stop at Washington and State. BusyBus informs users the arrival times of buses servicing Washington and State. The product also provides users with a visual aid, mapping out the user's current location as well as the location of the desired bus stop.</p>
              <p class="Busybus_page">A few takeaways from this project:</p>
              <p class="Busybus_page"><span class="important">Expect the unexpected:</span> The client's requirements can change at any point in time. I started off designing the app going in one direction, however when the client provided the content of the app, the design drastically changed to accomodate the information. The project taught me to be flexible and quick to adapt.</p>
              <p class="Busybus_page"><span class="important">Lost in translation:</span> BusyBus taught me to design realistically. Even if a designer creates the most aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly design, it may not translate well when coded. I learned to create designs that are not only user-friendly, but that also work well within the digital world.</p>
