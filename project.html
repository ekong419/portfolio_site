        <h2>LeChef</h2>
        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>As the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stoves were fired up, flour and yeast became sold out. Then recipe exchanges started and web browsers became filled with bookmarked recipes.</p>
        <p>The goal of LeChef is designed to organize all recipes - old and new - into one convenient location and can be easily shared with others. The recipes on LeChef can also be customized with notes, conversions, as well as a shopping list function.</p>
