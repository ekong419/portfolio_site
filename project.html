            <p class="Lechef_page">As the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stoves were fired up, flour and yeast became sold out. Then recipe exchanges started and web browsers became filled with bookmarked recipes.</p>
            <p class="Lechef_page">The goal of LeChef is designed to organize all recipes - old and new - into one convenient location and can be easily shared with others. The recipes on LeChef can also be customized with notes, conversions, as well as a shopping list function.</p>

            <p class="Lechef_page">Due to the 2020 global pandemic, people have been trying out new recipes and doing recipe exchanges with others. With the growing collection of recipes, people are having to keep track of which recipes are stored where. Even after the recipe has been found, customization to the recipe may not have been saved and possibly forgotten, frustrating users. As recipe exchanges have gotten increasingly popular, people have found that finding and sharing recipes is not as seamless as one may like.</p>

              <p class="Lechef_page">Through the survey, I discovered what type of features users would like to see in a recipe management app as well as how they would like to collaborate with others. From there, I was able to design the app with features that users would like to see included.</p>

            <h5 class="Lechef_page">Why LeChef?</h5>
              <p class="Lechef_page">The name of the app, LeChef, is meant to convey a sense of confidence within the user. When trying a recipe the first few times, the feeling can be daunting -</p>
              <p class="Lechef_page"><span class="key">Will it turn out good?<br>What if there isn't enough flavor?<br>Is it cooked enough?<br>Will others enjoy it?</span></p>
              <p class="Lechef_page">The title means "the chef" in French and chefs are given that title after years of experience. So the name is meant to give a sense of positivity, encouragement, and creativity for users.</p>
            <h5 class="Lechef_page">Typography and Colors</h5>
              <p class="Lechef_page">Cooking is a creative process and I wanted the app to give off that creative vibe that resonates with a wide range of users. The playful yet elegant characteristics are represented through the selected typography, <span class="type">Dancing Script</span> and <span class="important">EB Garamond</span>. The font pair balances fun and clarity.</p>
              <p class="Lechef_page">The color scheme of <span  class="color_Lechef">orange and red</span> were chosen since these colors spark one's appetite, making people feel hungry, which is appropriate for an app focused on food.</p>

                  <p class="Lechef_page">The final product fulfills the recipe organizational goal, with key features consisting of creating recipes as well as importing recipes from websites. The app also has a collaboration feature, allowing users to share recipes, which is an important factor during this global pandemic. The personalized feature include converting recipes and directly adding needed ingredients onto an app-embedded shopping list. These additional features give users a more seamless and comprehesive recipe management app. The styling choices made for LeChef will have users feeling inspired to cook and try reciipes on a creative platform.</p>
                  <p class="Lechef_page">Some takeaways from this project are:</p>
                  <p class="Lechef_page"><span class="important">Test, test, test:</span> Feedback on visual designs and functionality varies from person to person so getting as much feedback as possible is key to a good user experience.</p>
                  <p class="Lechef_page"><span class="important">Focusing on the MVP:</span> Additional features can easily distract from the main goal of the product. I learned that throughout the process, there are times when you have to step back and reevaluate where your focus and attention are currently and if it is in the best interest of users and the product to fixate on those features.</p>
