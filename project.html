        <h1>LeChef</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stoves were fired up, flour and yeast became sold out. Then recipe exchanges started and web browsers became filled with bookmarked recipes.</p>
        <p>The goal of LeChef is designed to organize all recipes - old and new - into one convenient location and can be easily shared with others. The recipes on LeChef can also be customized with notes, conversions, as well as a shopping list function.</p>

              <p>and hundreds of recipes...</p><br>
              <p>Due to the 2020 global pandemic, people have been trying out new recipes and doing recipe exchanges with others. With the growing collection of recipes, people are having to keep track of which recipes are stored where. Even after the recipe has been found, customization to the recipe may not have been saved and possibly forgotten, frustrating users. As recipe exchanges have gotten increasingly popular, people have found that finding and sharing recipes is not as seamless as one may like.</p>
