        <h1>LeChef</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As the world went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stoves were fired up, flour and yeast became sold out. Then recipe exchanges started and web browsers became filled with bookmarked recipes.</p>
        <p>The goal of LeChef is designed to organize all recipes - old and new - into one convenient location and can be easily shared with others. The recipes on LeChef can also be customized with notes, conversions, as well as a shopping list function.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
              <p>Pinterest.<br>Emails.<br>Bookmarks.<br>Cloud storage.</p>
              <p>and hundreds of recipes...</p>
              <p>Due to the 2020 global pandemic, people have been trying out new recipes and doing recipe exchanges with others. With the growing collection of recipes, people are having to keep track of which recipes are stored where. Even after the recipe has been found, customization to the recipe may not have been saved and possibly forgotten, frustrating users. As recipe exchanges have gotten increasingly popular, people have found that finding and sharing recipes is not as seamless as one may like.</p>

          <section class="survey">
            <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>
              <p>I conducted a user survey to explore:</p>
              <p>- how <span class="important">recipes</span> are organized<br>- what types of <span class="important">organizational tools</span> people used<br>- desired <span class="important">app features</span><br>- people's <span class="important">social media habits</span></p>
              <p>There were a total of <span class="important">18</span> participants.</p>
              <ul class="key"><h5>Key Discoveries</h5>
                <li>100% searched for food recipes on the internet</li>
                <li>1 out  of 18 currently use a recipe management app</li>
                <li>9 out of 17 have recipes bookmarked on their browser</li>
                <li>12 out of 17 would like to use a recipe management app to organize their recipes</li>
                <li>8 out of 12 would like to see collaborative tools in a recipe management app</li>
                <li>14 out of 18 use social media daily</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Through the survey, I discovered what type of features users would like to see in a recipe management app as well as how they would like to collaborate with others. From there, I was able to design the app with features that users would like to see included.</p>

            <section class="users">
              <h2>User Personas</h2>
              <p>From the user survey, I created the following user personas based on the survey responses.</p>
              <img class="persona1" src="images/persona1.png" alt="persona1"/>

              <h2>Branding</h2>
                <h5>Why LeChef?</h5>
                  <p>The name of the app, LeChef, is meant to convey a sense of confidence within the user. When trying a recipe the first few times, the feeling can be daunting -</p>
                  <p><span class="key">Will it turn out good?<br>What if there isn't enough flavor?<br>Is it cooked enough?<br>Will others enjoy it?</span></p>
                  <p>The title means "the chef" in French and chefs are given that title after years of experience. So the name is meant to give a sense of positivity, encouragement, and creativity for users.</p>
                  <h5>Typography and Colors</h5>
                    <p>Cooking is a creative process and I wanted the app to give off that creative vibe that resonates with a wide range of users. The playful yet elegant characteristics are represented through the selected typography, Dancing Script and EB Garamond. The font pair balances fun and clarity.</p>
                    <p>The color scheme of orange and red were chosen since these colors spark one's appetite, making people feel hungry, which is appropriate for an app focused on food.</p>

            <section class="stories">
              <h2>What is important to users?</h2>
                <p>These factors were discovered through the user survey conducted, creating the following prioritized user stories:</p>
                <ul class="user_stories">
                  <li>"I want to create an account."</li>

                  <li>"I want to create a new recipes."</li>
                  <li>"I want to import photos and/or videos."</li>
                  <li>"I want to create a new category."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I performed a usability test with 3 users who were asked to complete 3 tasks,</p>

              <h5>Results</h5>
                <p>From this test, I observed that users only struggled with creating a new category. Discussions with the testers revealed that the call to action was no specific enough. There was also confusion about where to find the category action, which meant that the flow was not obvious enough for testers.</p>

                  <p>The final product fulfills the recipe organizational goal, with key features consisting of creating recipes as well as importing recipes from websites. The app also has a collaboration feature, allowing users to share recipes, which is an important factor during this global pandemic. The personalized feature include converting recipes and directly adding needed ingredients onto an app-embedded shopping list. These additional features give users a more seamless and comprehesive recipe management app. The styling choices made for LeChef will have users feeling inspired to cook and try reciipes on a creative platform.</p>
                  <p>Some takeaways from this project are:</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Test, test, test:</span> Feedback on visual designs and functionality varies from person to person so getting as much feedback as possible is key to a good user experience.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Focusing on the MVP:</span> Additional features can easily distract from the main goal of the product. I learned that throughout the process, there are times when you have to step back and reevaluate where your focus and attention are currently and if it is in the best interest of users and the product to fixate on those features.</p>
